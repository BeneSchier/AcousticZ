Introduction
============

| In the modern times of numerical simulations and computer based research and
  science the possibilities of computational setups grow to infinity. In most 
  cases the computational setups save time, money and effort compared to real 
  world experiments such that it seems worth trying out a computational approach
  in the world of acoustic simulations.  
| But beside the usage for research purposes there are more applications for 
  this software. Just recently the usage of ray-tracing based acoustic 
  simulations found their entry into Virtual Reality Headsets and even computer 
  games could benefit from this method.   
| 
|
| AcousticZ is a python package that can simulate the real-world acoustic 
  characteristics of a room.
| It uses stochastic ray tracing to produce a Histogram that stores 
  corresponding energy values to frequency and time. 
| The Histogram can then be used to generate a Room-Impulse-Response (RIR) of an 
  arbitray 3D room geometry. This Response can be used to filter an audio file
  which is then the simulated response of the room in terms of auralization and 
  reverbant effects.

| In the realm of modern numerical simulations and computer-based research, the 
  potential for computational setups knows no bounds. These setups often offer a 
  time-efficient, cost-effective, and effortless alternative to real-world 
  experiments. In the field of acoustic simulations, embracing a computational 
  approach not only holds great promise for research purposes but also extends 
  its reach to various other applications.
| 
| Introducing AcousticZ, a cutting-edge Python package that harnesses the power 
  of ray tracing to simulate the intricate acoustic properties of real-world 
  environments. This versatile software opens up a realm of possibilities, 
  transcending the boundaries of traditional acoustic modeling.
| 
| With its innovative stochastic ray tracing technique, AcousticZ generates a 
  comprehensive Histogram that captures and stores energy values, correlated 
  with both frequency and time. This Histogram serves as the foundation for 
  generating a highly accurate Room Impulse Response (RIR) for any arbitrary 3D 
  room geometry. The resulting RIR is an immersive representation of the room's 
  acoustic behavior, encompassing the intricate interplay of auralization and 
  reverberant effects.

| Beyond its value in research, AcousticZ has found its way into groundbreaking 
  domains. The rise of Virtual Reality Headsets has paved the path for 
  ray-tracing-based acoustic simulations to enhance immersive experiences. 
  Even the realm of computer games can now benefit from the unparalleled realism 
  and authenticity that AcousticZ brings to the virtual soundscape.

| In summary, AcousticZ stands at the forefront of acoustic simulation software, 
  empowering researchers, developers, and enthusiasts alike to delve into the rich 
  world of computational acoustics. By seamlessly bridging the gap between virtual 
  and real-world environments, it revolutionizes our ability to explore, understand, 
  and recreate the captivating realm of sound.
