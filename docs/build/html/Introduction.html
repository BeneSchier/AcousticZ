<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In the modern times of numerical simulations and computer based research and
science the possibilities of computational setups grow to infinity. In most
cases the computational setups save time, money and effort compared to real
world experiments such that it seems worth trying out a computational approach
in the world of acoustic simulations.</div>
<div class="line">But beside the usage for research purposes there are more applications for
this software. Just recently the usage of ray-tracing based acoustic
simulations found their entry into Virtual Reality Headsets and even computer
games could benefit from this method.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">AcousticZ is a python package that can simulate the real-world acoustic
characteristics of a room.</div>
<div class="line">It uses stochastic ray tracing to produce a Histogram that stores
corresponding energy values to frequency and time.</div>
<div class="line">The Histogram can then be used to generate a Room-Impulse-Response (RIR) of an
arbitray 3D room geometry. This Response can be used to filter an audio file
which is then the simulated response of the room in terms of auralization and
reverbant effects.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In the realm of modern numerical simulations and computer-based research, the
potential for computational setups knows no bounds. These setups often offer a
time-efficient, cost-effective, and effortless alternative to real-world
experiments. In the field of acoustic simulations, embracing a computational
approach not only holds great promise for research purposes but also extends
its reach to various other applications.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Introducing AcousticZ, a cutting-edge Python package that harnesses the power
of ray tracing to simulate the intricate acoustic properties of real-world
environments. This versatile software opens up a realm of possibilities,
transcending the boundaries of traditional acoustic modeling.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">With its innovative stochastic ray tracing technique, AcousticZ generates a
comprehensive Histogram that captures and stores energy values, correlated
with both frequency and time. This Histogram serves as the foundation for
generating a highly accurate Room Impulse Response (RIR) for any arbitrary 3D
room geometry. The resulting RIR is an immersive representation of the room’s
acoustic behavior, encompassing the intricate interplay of auralization and
reverberant effects.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Beyond its value in research, AcousticZ has found its way into groundbreaking
domains. The rise of Virtual Reality Headsets has paved the path for
ray-tracing-based acoustic simulations to enhance immersive experiences.
Even the realm of computer games can now benefit from the unparalleled realism
and authenticity that AcousticZ brings to the virtual soundscape.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In summary, AcousticZ stands at the forefront of acoustic simulation software,
empowering researchers, developers, and enthusiasts alike to delve into the rich
world of computational acoustics. By seamlessly bridging the gap between virtual
and real-world environments, it revolutionizes our ability to explore, understand,
and recreate the captivating realm of sound.</div>
