Introduction
============


| In the realm of modern numerical simulations and computer-based research, the 
  potential for computational setups knows no bounds. These setups often offer a 
  time-efficient, cost-effective, and effortless alternative to real-world 
  experiments. In the field of acoustic simulations, embracing a computational 
  approach not only holds great promise for research purposes but also extends 
  its reach to various other applications.

| Introducing AcousticZ, a Python package that harnesses the power 
  of ray tracing to simulate the intricate acoustic properties of real-world 
  environments.

| With its stochastic ray tracing technique, AcousticZ generates a 
  comprehensive Histogram that captures and stores energy values, correlated 
  with both frequency and time. This Histogram serves as the foundation for 
  generating a highly accurate Room Impulse Response (RIR) for any arbitrary 3D 
  room geometry. The resulting RIR is a representation of the room's 
  acoustic behavior, encompassing the intricate interplay of auralization and 
  reverberant effects.

| Beyond its value in research, RIR simulation has found its way into 
  groundbreaking domains. The rise of Virtual Reality Headsets has paved the 
  path for ray-tracing-based acoustic simulations to enhance immersive 
  experiences. Even the realm of computer games can now benefit from the 
  unparalleled realism and authenticity that this technique brings to the 
  virtual soundscape.
